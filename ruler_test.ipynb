All the rulers belong to the Abdali tribal group, whose name was changed to Dorrani on the accession of Ahmad Shah. They belong either to the Saddozay segment of the Popalzay clan (typically with the style padshah [king]) or to the Mohammadzay segment of the Barakzay clan (typically with the style amir, in full Amir al-Mo´menin [Leader of the Faithful]). The Mohammadzay also furnished the Saddozay kings frequently with top counselors, who served occasionally as regents, identified with the epithet Mohammadzay.KabulKings- Saddozay segment -   Jul 1747 - 16 Oct 1772  Ahmad Shah \"Dorr-e Dorran\"         (b. 1724 - d. 1772)16 Oct 1772 - 18 May 1793  Timur Shah                         (b. 1748 - d. 1793)23 May 1793 -        1801  Zaman Shah                         (b. 1770/72 - d. 1844)25 Jul 1801 -    Jul 1803  Mahmud Shah (1st time)13 Jul 1803 -        1809  Shoja` al-Molk Shah (1st time)     (b. c.1792 - d. 1842) 3 May 1808 -        1808    Qaysar Shah (in rebellion) 3 May 1809 -        1818  Mahmud Shah (2nd time)       1818 -        1819  Soltan `Ali Shah       1819 -        1823  Ayyub Shah- Mohammadzay segment -       1823                Habibollah Shah       1823 -        1826  Soltan Mohammad Khan Mohammadzay                           (regent)       1826 -        1836  Dost Mohammad Khan Mohammadzay     (b. 1789 - d. 1863)                           (regent)Emir- Mohammadzay segment -       1836 -  2 Aug 1839  Dost Mohammad Khan (1st time)      (s.a.)King- Saddozay segment - 8 May 1839 -  5 Apr 1842  Shoja` al-Molk Shah (2nd time)     (s.a.)       1841 -    Apr 1842    Mohammad Zaman Khan Mohammadzay                             (regent) (in rebellion)Emirs- Saddozay segment -29 Jun 1842 - 12 Oct 1842  Fath Jang Khan12 Oct 1842 -    Dec 1842  Shahpur Khan- Mohammadzay segment -   Dec 1842 -  9 Jun 1863  Dost Mohammad Khan (2nd time)      (s.a.)       1863 -    May 1866  Shir `Ali Khan (1st time)          (b. 1825 - d. 1879)   May 1866 -  7 Oct 1867  Mohammad Afzal Khan                (b. 1811 - d. 1867) 7 Oct 1867 -  8 Sep 1868  Mohammad A`zam Khan                (b. 18... - d. 1869) 8 Sep 1868 - 21 Feb 1879  Shir `Ali Khan (2nd time)          (s.a.)21 Feb 1879 - 12 Oct 1879  Mohammad Ya`qub Khan               (b. 1849 - d. 1923)       1879 - 31 Mar 1880  Mohammad Jan (minister-regent)     (b. ... - d. 1880)22 Jul 1880 -  3 Oct 1901  Abdor Rahman Khan                  (b. 1844 - d. 1901)HeratKings- Saddozay segment -   Jul 1747 -        1797  see Kabul       1797                Mahmud Shah (1st time)       1797 -        1818  see Kabul       1818 -        1819  Mahmud Shah (2nd time)       1819                see Kandahar       1819 -        1826  Mahmud Shah (3rd time)       1826 -    Mar 1842  Kamran Shah   Mar 1842 -  1 Jun 1851  Yar Mohammad Khan Alikozay                           (minister-regent) 1 Jun 1851 - 15 Sep 1855  Sayyed Mohammad Khan Alikozay                           (minister-regent)15 Sep 1855 -    Jun 1856  Mohammad Yusuf Khan Mohammadzay                           (regent)   Jun 1856 -    Oct 1856  Isa Khan Bardorani                           (minister-regent)   Oct 1856 - 27 Jul 1857  occupied by IranEmirs- Mohammadzay segment -27 Jul 1857 - 26 May 1863  Soltan Ahmad Khan                  (b. ... - d. 1863)26 May 1863 -  9 Jun 1863  see Kabul 9 Jun 1863 -  8 Sep 1868  Shir `Ali Khan                     (s.a.) 8 Sep 1868 - 12 Oct 1879  see Kabul   Mar 1880 -  2 Oct 1881  Mohammad Ayyub Khan                (b. 1855 - d. 1914)KandaharKings- Saddozay segment -   Jul 1747 - 16 Oct 1772  see Kabul16 Oct 1772 -        1772  Solayman Shah       1772 - 18 May 1793  see Kabul18 May 1793 - 19 Jun 1793  Homayun Shah19 Jun 1793 -        1804  see Kabul       1804 -        1805  Kamran Shah       1805 -        1808  see Kabul       1808                Mahmud Shah (1st time)       1808 -        1809  see Kabul       1809 -  3 May 1809  Mahmud Shah (2nd time) 3 May 1809 -        1818  see Kabul       1819 -        1826  Shirdil Khan Mohammadzay (regent)       1826 -        1839  Purdil Khan Mohammadzay (regent)   Apr 1839 -  5 Apr 1842  Shoja` al-Molk Shah                (s.a.)

Jan. 25, 1935, Alcains, Portugal), president of Portugal (1976-86). He joined the army in 1953 and fought in the colonial wars in Africa. An opponent of Portugal\\'s colonial policies, he supported the 1974 coup that ended the dictatorship. He returned to Portugal from Angola following the coup and served as the Armed Forces Movement\\'s representative to the Portuguese television network. He retained that position until March 1975, when he was implicated in a counter-coup led by supporters of Gen. António de Spínola. Eanes was exonerated after an inquiry. He returned to the military and became an opponent of the nationalization program sponsored by the government of Premier Vasco dos Santos Gonçalves. He was instrumental in suppressing a far-left coup in November 1975 and for this role was promoted from a relatively unknown colonel to army chief of staff in December. On June 27, 1976, General Eanes was elected president. A non-party candidate supported by the Socialists, Popular Democrats, and Social Democrats, he won 61.5% of the vote. He was also chief of the armed forces general staff (1976-81) and president of the Council of the Revolution (1976-82). He was reelected as president on Dec. 7, 1980, with 56.4% of the vote. Legally barred from a third term, he was succeeded in 1986 by his former prime minister Mário Soares. During his presidency, Eanes upheld the new democratic regime amidst the debilitating squabbles of the political parties, and his honesty won him wide popular support. In 1986-87 he was leader of the Democratic Renewal Party.<P>\\n\\n<B>Eardley, Richard R(oy)</B> (b. Dec. 23, 1928, Denver, Colo. - d.

He was a member (1928-32) of the state House of Representatives but entered national politics when he was appointed (1941) to fill a vacant Senate seat after the death of Sen. Pat Harrison. He won election to the seat in 1942. During his long tenure as Democratic senator, he was notable for his staunch opposition to desegregation and became one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill as chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 22 years, a position he used in killing 127 civil-rights bills. He also served on the Agriculture and Forestry Committee, chaired the Immigration and Naturalization Subcommittee, was adviser to the Senate Appropriations Committee, and in 1972 was elected president pro tempore of the Senate. A staunch anti-Communist, Eastland maintained that Communists had infiltrated civil-rights organizations, and he was ardently in favour of U.S. involvement in Vietnam to \"rattle the teeth of the Reds.\" When it became apparent that he could not rally the black vote for his reelection to the Senate, Eastland retired in 1978.<P>\\n\\n<B>Eastman, (Theophilus) Ernest</B> (b.

August 1591, Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, England - d. Jan. 7, 1658, New Haven [now in Connecticut]), governor of New Haven colony (1639-58). He was sent by King Charles I as an agent to the court of Denmark, where he remained several years. When he returned to London from his residence in Copenhagen, he became interested in the settlement of New England. He was one of the original patentees of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Having adopted firm Puritan beliefs, he joined his boyhood friend John Davenport and several Puritan followers in migrating to New England in early 1637. The group arrived in Boston in June, and he was chosen to be a magistrate. But instead of settling in Massachusetts Bay, they determined to establish an independent colony. Accordingly they selected a place called Quinnipiac in April 1638, bought the land from the Indians for thirteen English coats, and named it New Haven. The next year Eaton was elected governor of the colony, and he was reelected annually until his death. In 1643 he became an original commissioner in the New England Confederation, and 12 years later he and Davenport drew up a new legal code for New Haven colony. As governor, Eaton also became involved in various mercantile endeavours, some of which provoked tensions with the Dutch in neighbouring New Netherlands, but he soon abandoned them for agriculture.<P>\\n\\n<B>Ebaka, Jean-Michel</B> (b. 193... - d.

Feb. 2, 1915, Cape Town, South Africa - d. Nov. 17, 2002, Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel), foreign minister of Israel (1966-74). Brought up in England, he used the surname of his mother\\'s second husband Isaac Eban. In 1946 he worked with the Jewish Agency as a political information officer to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also served as the liaison officer with the UN Special Committee on Palestine in 1947 and as a member of the delegation to the General Assembly that played a critical role in the passage of the UN resolution to partition Palestine. He adopted his Hebrew name Abba soon after Israel\\'s independence in 1948. When the new state was admitted to membership in the UN in 1949, he became its permanent representative, and from 1950 he served concurrently as ambassador to the United States. He held both posts until 1959 when he was first elected to the Knesset and became a minister without portfolio. He was minister of education and culture in 1960-63 and deputy prime minister in 1964-65. As foreign minister, he sought to strengthen relations with the U.S. and to bring about Israeli association with the European Economic Community. When Israel was threatened with an Arab blockade in May 1967, he traveled to Paris, London, and Washington to seek a peaceful solution. When diplomacy proved fruitless, he supported the military decisions in the Six-Day War. His eloquent defense of Israel\\'s actions before the UN Security Council and General Assembly was widely admired. He sat in the Knesset as a member of the Labour Party until 1988. He came out in favour of the establishment of a Palestinian state and berated right-wing Israeli politicians for believing they could hold onto the lands occupied in the 1967 war.<P>\\n\\n<B>Ebanks, Donovan (W.F.)</B> (b. 1947), acting governor of the Cayman Islands (2009-10).

Oct. 11, 2002, Berlin), first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Magdeburg district (1983-89). He was best known to East Germans as the chief interpreter and adviser during the rule of Walter Ulbricht, under whose government the Berlin Wall was built. He served on the Politburo in the 1980s, and was accused after German reunification in 1990 of manslaughter for failing to act against the \"shoot to kill orders\" issued to border guards. Eberlein, seriously ill and wheelchair-bound for 11 years, was never prosecuted.<P>\\n\\n<A NAME=\"ebert\"><TABLE ALIGN=\"Right\"><TR><TD><IMG SRC=\"ebert.jpg\" HEIGHT=\"100\"><BR>Ebert</TR></TABLE>\\n<B>Ebert, Friedrich</B> (b. Feb. 4, 1871, Heidelberg [now in Baden-Württemberg], Germany - d. Feb. 28, 1925, Berlin, Germany), president of Germany (1919-25). In 1905 he became secretary general of the German Social Democratic Party, and he succeeded August Bebel as party chairman in 1913. On the day of the revolution when Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated (Nov. 9, 1918), Prince Max of Baden asked Ebert to replace him as chancellor. Ebert, who still hoped to establish a regency for the emperor, actually held office as chancellor for one day. On November 10 he set up an entirely Socialist government. Calling itself the Council of People\\'s Representatives, the government derived its authority from the Workers\\' and Soldiers\\' Council, which claimed to speak for Germany and the German Republic but had been elected rather arbitrarily by the factories and regiments of Berlin alone. Ebert was determined to place power in the hands of a freely elected German parliament as soon as possible. Following the elections of January 1919, he was elected the first president of the republic. When, in January 1923, Germany was declared in default of coal deliveries under the reparations provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, France, wishing to settle the reparations question decisively, occupied the Ruhr territory. Ebert, like nearly all Germans, supported national resistance and the general strike in the Ruhr, which was directed toward ending foreign military control. But Germany suffered as a result of the strike. Inflation assumed staggering proportions, and the country experienced its most severe social and political crisis. Adolf Hitler nearly succeeded in seizing power in Bavaria. Chancellor Gustav Stresemann brought the crisis under control, yet much of the German right persisted in its defamation of Ebert. He died in office.<P>\\n\\n<B>Ebert, Friedrich,</B> byname Fritz Ebert (b. Sept. 12, 1894, Bremen, Germany - d. Dec. 4, 1979, East Berlin, East Germany), lord mayor of East Berlin (1948-67) and acting chairman of the Council of State of East Germany (1973); son of Friedrich Ebert (1871-1925).<P>\\n\\n<A NAME=\"eboue\"><TABLE ALIGN=\"Right\"><TR><TD><IMG SRC=\"eboue.jpg\" HEIGHT=\"100\"><BR>Éboué</TR></TABLE>\\n<B>Éboué, (Adolphe) Félix (Sylvestre)</B> (b. Dec. 26, 1884, Cayenne, French Guiana - d. May 17, 1944, Cairo, Egypt), French colonial administrator. He was first sent to Oubangui-Chari (now the Central African Republic), where he spent most of his career. During an extended leave in the early 1920s, he broadened his contacts with leaders in France, including Blaise Diagne, the first African deputy to the French National Assembly. Although he eventually reached the rank of administrator in chief in 1930, his promotions were slow - not because of his being black, he believed, but because of the low status of Africa and its administrators in the French colonial empire. He served as acting governor of Martinique (1933-34) and of French Sudan (1935) and finally in 1936 he was made a full governor in Guadeloupe, becoming the first black man to reach the highest level of the French colonial administrative system. In Guadeloupe he introduced many reforms associated with the Popular Front government in France, but he also made enemies there who probably influenced his transfer in 1938 to Chad, one of the poorest countries in Africa. As <I>chef de territoire</I> there (1939-40) he became the key figure in rallying to Gen. Charles de Gaulle that strategically located colony as well as all of French Equatorial Africa. This step enabled a French army to be formed under Gen. Jacques Leclerc, who later led it across 1,600 km of desert to make contact with the British 8th Army in Libya. In return, de Gaulle named Éboué governor-general over the entire federation (1940) and further honoured him in 1944 by holding the Brazzaville Conference (to discuss postwar colonial reforms) in his capital; he died a few months later. In 1949 he became the only black to be buried in France\\'s Panthéon of heroes in Paris. His widow Eugénie Éboué-Tell (1891-1972) was elected a French\\ndeputy and senator from Guadeloupe.<P>\\n\\n<B>Ebouka-Babackas, Édouard</B> (b.

He was elected to parliament as a Republican People\\'s Party (RPP) member for Ankara (1957, 1961) and Zonguldak (1965, 1969). He was minister of labour in 1961-65 and in 1966 he became secretary-general of the RPP under Ismet Inönü, whose cooperation with the country\\'s military government he opposed. He became RPP chairman in 1972 and prime minister in 1974. He declared an amnesty for all political prisoners and authorized (July 20, 1974) Turkey\\'s military intervention in Cyprus after the Greek-led coup on that island. His request for a vote of confidence from the parliament in September 1974 failed. After further crises in 1977, during which he briefly formed a government, he was again prime minister in 1978, but acute economic and social difficulties led to the fall of this government in 1979. After a military coup in 1980 he was in detention and charged with \"acts of treason\" for failing to prevent nationwide street violence between the left and the right that led to the military intervention. He was imprisoned three times for continuing his political activities despite the ban, mainly through his wife Rahsan (1923-2020), a political force in her own right, who formed the Democratic Left Party (DSP) in 1985 and led it until 1987 reforms allowed him back into politics. In June 1997 he became deputy prime minister under Mesut Yilmaz and after the Yilmaz government was overturned on corruption allegations, Ecevit became prime minister again. His popularity was boosted in 1999 by the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Öcalan. In 2002 he became ill but resisted calls for his resignation, and his party was obliterated in elections.

He became the private secretary of the president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1940. He rose rapidly in political circles and held several important posts in government and the PRI, including director of press and propaganda and president of the Federal Electoral Commission. In 1957 he became minister of education, in 1958 subsecretary of the interior, and in 1964 Pres. Gustavo Díaz Ordaz appointed him secretary of the interior, a post he held until November 1969. He was severely criticized for his harsh handling of the 1968 student demonstrations that culminated in the \"Tlatelolco massacre,\" in which more than 300 demonstrators were killed or wounded and thousands arrested. After becoming president, he moved sharply to the left, releasing most of the prisoners arrested in 1968, redistributing millions of acres among the landless peasantry, expanding social security, housing, and transportation programs, and pouring huge sums of money into public works. Reversing an earlier stand, he introduced a national family planning program to reduce population growth. His administration was plagued by runaway inflation, high unemployment, and illiteracy, and his leftist economic proposals alienated business interests, causing reduced domestic investment. A declining balance of trade forced the devaluation of the peso by 50% in 1976, producing insecurity and antagonism among his middle-class supporters. In foreign policy, he opened diplomatic relations with China and supported Latin American solidarity. He served as ambassador to Australia and New Zealand (1977-80) under his successor, Pres. José López Portillo. In 2004 a judge rejected a request for Echeverría\\'s arrest on charges of genocide for allegedly ordering the killing of student demonstrators on June 10, 1971.

He spent most of his appointed term as governor attempting to curb the threat of pirates, the most powerful of which at this time was Edward Teach (\"Blackbeard\"). Eden offered him the royal pardon if he would give himself up, whereupon he surrendered with twenty of his followers, but he soon returned to his old habits. Eden was rumoured to have a close personal relationship with Blackbeard and to have shared in his loot. Edward Mosely, a prominent colonist, declared that the governor could raise an armed posse to arrest honest men, but could not raise a similar force to apprehend Teach. For his accusations, Mosely was arrested, fined £100, and debarred from holding office for three years. Teach took over an island on the Carolina coast and set himself up as almost a prince, taxing the traders throughout his realm. The Carolinians despaired of help from their own governor, and got a small army from the governor of Virginia which killed Blackbeard in 1718. In 1719 Eden gave to the council a full account of his dealings with the pirate, which was approved by them. In 1718 Eden had been made landgrave of Carolina, a hereditary nobility provided for in the Fundamental Constitutions, written for the colony by John Locke.<P>\\n\\n<B>Edén, Nils</B> (b.

The Republican won a seat in the state legislature in 1976, and in 1981, Gov. James Thompson appointed him secretary of state, where he garnered attention by pushing through an anti-drunk-driving law. In 1990, Edgar ran to succeed Thompson, with strong opposition from Democratic Attorney General Neil Hartigan. Ironically, Hartigan talked of cutting taxes and running government like a business; Edgar promised to make permanent the 1989 tax surcharge for education. Both favored an initiative requiring a 60% state House and Senate vote for a tax increase. Edgar narrowly won, 51%-48%. The first governor since the 1920s to have served in the legislature, he helped Republicans capture the state Senate in 1992. Entering 1994, Edgar did not seem invulnerable. But he won with a record margin, in part because of the issue stands of his opponent, Comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch. A lakefront liberal state senator for 18 years, Netsch proposed a big increase in state income taxes, together with property tax reductions, to finance education. Edgar bragged of increased education funding and a lower-than-national unemployment rate. Edgar won overwhelmingly, carrying 101 of 102 counties (losing one southern Downstate county by 3 votes), and saw Republicans sweep all the statewide offices and capture control of the state House. He entered 1995 in a position of political strength not equalled in the last three generations, hoping to cut state government employment further, implement tort reform, and try further reforms of the welfare system. In March 1995, he signed legislation that eliminated the AFDC program by 1999 and capped other welfare benefits.<P>\\n\\n<B>Edge, Walter E(vans)</B> (b. Nov. 20, 1873, Philadelphia, Pa. - d.

He returned to Panama as Panama Canal maintenance engineer from 1936 to 1940, then he was appointed governor of the Panama Canal Zone. During his tenure, several administrative changes occurred: the organization formerly known as the Bureau of Clubs and Playgrounds was designated the Panama Canal clubhouses; the special construction division and the special engineering division were consolidated under the title of the special engineer division. During his administration, also, the highway and railroad bridge across the canal at the existing Miraflores locks was officially opened to vehicular traffic in 1942, thus providing the first permanent bridge connection between the east and west banks of the canal since the canal was opened in 1914, and the excavation for the third locks project was initiated.

The second child and eldest son of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, he was soon after his birth created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester (Dec. 4, 1841). In November 1858 he was made a knight of the garter and a colonel in the army. On March 10, 1863, he married Alexandra, eldest daughter of Prince Christian (later King Christian IX) of Denmark. Five children of this union survived to maturity (George, Duke of York, subsequently King George V, was the second son). The prince became a familiar figure in the sporting world. He was particularly given to racing, yachting, and game-bird shooting. His social activities involved him in several scandals. He succeeded to the throne as Edward VII following Victoria\\'s death on Jan. 22, 1901, and was crowned on Aug. 9, 1902. His reign did much to restore lustre to a monarchy that had shone somewhat dimly during Victoria\\'s long seclusion as a widow. In 1902 he resumed his tours of Europe. His geniality and felicitously worded addresses (conducted in French) during a state visit to Paris in 1903 helped pave the way, by winning popularity among French citizens of all ranks, for the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale of 1904. Relations with his nephew the German emperor Wilhelm II were not always easy, either officially or personally. Although incapable of prolonged mental exertion, Edward was fortunate in his judgment of men. His support for the great military reforms of the secretary of state for war, Richard Burdon (later Viscount) Haldane, and for First Sea Lord Sir John Fisher in his naval reforms did much to avert British unpreparedness when World War I started.<P>\\n\\n<A NAME=\"edwar8\"><TABLE ALIGN=\"Right\"><TR><TD><IMG SRC=\"edwar8.jpg\" HEIGHT=\"100\"><BR>Edward VIII</TR></TABLE>\\n<B>Edward VIII,</B> also called (from 1936) Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor, in full Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David (known as David within the royal family) (b.

The eldest child of George, Duke of York (later King George V), and Princess Mary of Teck (later Queen Mary), he became heir to the throne on the accession of his father (May 6, 1910), being created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on June 23, 1910. In 1930 the prince\\'s friendship with Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson of the United States began. By 1934 he was deeply in love with her. George V died Jan. 20, 1936, and Edward was proclaimed king. His attempts to gain the royal family\\'s acceptance of Mrs. Simpson, who obtained a preliminary decree of divorce on Oct. 27, 1936, met with firm opposition, backed by the Church of England (of which he was the head) and most politicians in both Britain and the Commonwealth. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin attempted to impress upon the king the peril to the integrity of the monarchy caused by the private friendship with a divorcée. Discussions of a morganatic marriage were pursued, but on December 2 Baldwin assured him that this was impracticable. It was doomed by being somewhat hurriedly and forcibly put to the dominions and by the explosion of the whole matter in the press and Parliament on December 3. The king submitted his abdication on Dec. 10, 1936, the only British sovereign ever voluntarily to resign the crown. The instrument of abdication was endorsed by Parliament on December 11. The new king, George VI, created his older brother Duke of Windsor (effective March 8, 1937). On June 3, 1937, Edward was married to Mrs. Simpson by a clergyman of the Church of England at the Château de Candé, Monts, France. He was governor of the Bahamas in 1940-45.

Nov. 19, 1924, Kampala, Uganda - d. Nov. 21, 1969, London, England), <I>kabaka</I> (ruler) of Buganda (1939-53, 1955-66) and president of Uganda (1963-66). He was the only son of Daudi Cwa II, 35th <I>kabaka</I> of Buganda, by his Christian wife, Irene Drusila Namaganda. During the 1940s Mutesa, called \"King Freddie\" by the Western press, was essentially controlled by the British resident and his <I>katikkiro</I> (prime minister) and was personally rather unpopular. In the \"Kabaka crisis\" of 1953, when loss of the privileged position of the kingdom of Buganda within the protectorate of Uganda seemed imminent, he took an unyielding stand in meetings with the governor of Uganda so as not to alienate his increasingly suspicious and anti-British subjects. His key demands were for separation of Buganda from the rest of Uganda and a promise of independence. When he refused to communicate British formal recommendations to his Lukiko (parliament), he was arrested and deported. Buganda leaders engineered his return in 1955, ostensibly as a constitutional monarch, but one with a great deal of influence in the Buganda government. When Uganda became independent, Prime Minister Milton Obote first hoped to placate the Ganda by encouraging Mutesa\\'s election as president (a non-executive post) in 1963. A conflict over the role and over the continued integrity of the Buganda kingdom within Uganda followed. When he tried to foment discontent between the traditionally stateless northerners and the southern \"kingdom\" members, Obote suspended the constitution. The conflict escalated rapidly, and Mutesa was forced to flee to Britain in 1966, where he died in exile (of alcoholic poisoning, foul play being suspected by some).<P>\\n\\n<B>Edwardes, George Warren</B> (b.

The Democrat was first elected to Congress after the incumbent was killed in a car accident. A charismatic populist, he was first elected governor in 1972 by a narrow margin over Bennett Johnston and David Treen. Treen succeeded Edwards in 1979, but Edwards came back and beat Treen in 1983, then spent much of 1986 and 1987 under trial for bribery charges. He was acquitted, but suffered significant political damage. In 1987 he was able to win only 28% against Buddy Roemer, and withdrew and left Roemer to win without a runoff. In 1991, he improved only slightly, winning 34% in the primary; both times his platform was vintage Edwards - a state lottery, casino gambling in New Orleans, one-man state budgeting. But the political misfortunes of Roemer and the rally against David Duke returned Edwards to the governorship. In his last term Edwards got the legislature to approve casino gambling in New Orleans, after it already allowed riverboat gambling and video poker. He switched from a flat rate to a percentage tax on oil and gas, started two new Mississippi River bridges, and attracted new business that helped the state grow economically in the early 1990s. He got a larger share of state spending dedicated to education. In June 1994 he announced he was not running again in 1995. He was indicted in November 1998 and convicted in May 2000 of racketeering, extortion, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy for demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars from applicants for riverboat casino licenses. In January 2001 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and given a $250,000 fine; his son Stephen Edwards was sentenced to 7 years and fined $60,000.<P>\\n\\n<B>Edwards, Henry W(aggaman)</B> (b.

He was a personal friend of Menachem Begin and, after the Likud victory in 1977, was appointed finance minister. Ehrlich implemented policies to encourage private enterprise and reduce government subsidies, but he was blamed for failing to control inflation. In 1979 he became a deputy prime minister, and in 1981 he became minister of agriculture as well and took over responsibility for settlement on the West Bank. But in most respects he was considered a moderate, and it was Ehrlich who led the attacks on former defense minister Ariel Sharon over the latter\\'s conduct of the invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

Nixon - the 1960 presidential and 1962 California gubernatorial races - and was a strategist in the successful 1968 presidential campaign, and in 1969 he went to the White House, first as counsel and then as domestic affairs adviser. Along with H.R. Haldeman, Ehrlichman became ensconced as one of Nixon\\'s top advisers; the two became known as the \"Berlin Wall\" because they so successfully shielded the president from unwelcome intrusion. Ehrlichman also formed a group known as the \"plumbers,\" charged with the task of plugging information leaks and obtaining political intelligence. When the plumbers were caught in a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, the White House immediately engaged in a cover-up. The scandal that ensued when the involvement of Nixon and a number of his aides was uncovered eventually led to the resignation from government of several officials, including Ehrlichman and Haldeman (1973), Nixon\\'s resignation from the presidency (1974), and the conviction (1975) and imprisonment of Ehrlichman and others. He was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury, also on charges stemming from another break-in.

In November 1932 he became a member of Heinrich Himmler\\'s SS elite organization and from January to October 1934 he was attached to an SS unit at Dachau and then was appointed to the SD central office in Berlin, where he was attached to the section that dealt with Jewish affairs. He advanced steadily in the SS hierarchy and, after the annexation of Austria (March 1938), was sent to Vienna with the mission of ridding the city of Jews. One year later, with a similar mission, he was sent to Prague. When in 1939 Himmler formed the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, Eichmann was transferred to its Jewish section in Berlin. In January 1942, at Wannsee, near Berlin, a conference of Nazi high officials was convened to organize schedules and logistics arrangements necessary to implement the \"final solution\" of the Jewish problem. Eichmann was to coordinate these arrangements; thus, although the fact that the \"final solution\" was mass execution had not become generally known, Eichmann had in effect been named chief executioner. Thereupon he organized the identification, assembly, and transportation of Jews from all over occupied Europe to their final destinations at Auschwitz and other death camps. Following the war, Eichmann was captured by U.S. troops, but in 1946 he escaped from the prison camp. Assuming the name Ricardo Klement, he moved to Argentina in 1950. He was arrested by Israeli secret service agents near Buenos Aires on May 11, 1960; nine days later he was smuggled out of the country and taken to Israel. The Israeli government arranged his trial before a special three-judge court in Jerusalem (April 11-Dec. 15, 1961), and he was sentenced to be hanged.<P>\\n\\n<B>Eichmann, Franz August</B> (b.

His career was almost entirely literary and academic until 1919, when he was nominated to the Italian Senate, an honorary body, in which he urged a liberal economic policy, free from protectionism. A staunch anti-Fascist, he fled to Switzerland in 1943, where, along with other exiled Italians, he advocated the idea of a European federation. Returning to Italy in 1945, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Italy. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly (1946-48) and in 1947 became deputy prime minister and minister of the budget, a new post in which he successfully curbed inflation and stabilized the currency. He was totally devoted to his cause during those strenuous times, so much that he would refuse to leave a cabinet meeting for any reason lest in his absence, even for a few minutes, some other minister might suggest a new expenditure which the treasury could not cover. In 1948 he became a member of the Senate of the Italian republic and on May 11 was elected president of the republic. His seven-year term ended in 1955 but, though 81 years of age, he offered himself for reelection. In the event he was overwhelmingly defeated by Giovanni Gronchi.

In 1933 he became an aide to Douglas MacArthur, army chief of staff. Eisenhower was made chief of staff of the 3rd Army in 1941. During World War II, he became commander of the Allied forces in Europe (June 1942) and directed the Allied invasions of North Africa (1942) and Italy (1943). As supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, he planned the invasion of Europe that began when he ordered the landing in Normandy (June 1944) and ended after the Allies crossed the Rhine (March 1945), and Germany surrendered in May. He was named chief of staff in November 1945. He directed the demobilization of the wartime army and worked to unify the armed services. In May 1948 he left active duty. In the fall of 1950 Pres. Harry Truman asked him to become supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and in early 1951 he flew to Paris to assume his new position. In June 1952 he retired from the army, returned to the United States, and began his presidential campaign actively. At the Republican convention in July, he won the nomination on the first ballot. His running mate was Sen. Richard M. Nixon of California. Democrats nominated Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson. The Eisenhower-Nixon ticket won handily, carrying 39 states and winning the electoral vote 442-89.

He set up the Mongolian Democratic Union, the first non-party democratic group set up in 1989 to nurture change. Mongolians remember him as a young political radical standing on a chair to address pro-democracy crowds and hunger strikers in Ulaanbaatar\\'s main square in 1990. He was elected to parliament in 1990 and 1992, but resigned his seat in protest in 1994 after being cleared of charges that he had stolen and publicized state secrets. He became chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP) in April 1996. A public opinion poll conducted at the beginning of June 1996 showed 40% of respondents regarded Elbegdorj as the public official they approved of most. He was again elected to parliament in 1996. He was barred from joining the government under laws that prevented members of parliament from being elected to the cabinet. Those laws were changed in 1998, and in April the Democratic Union Coalition, of which the NDP was the largest party, decided that the head of its majority party should be prime minister. His term was cut short by a banking scandal, which resulted in a no-confidence motion. When in 2004 neither the incumbent Mongolian People\\'s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) nor the opposition Motherland Democratic Coalition won enough seats to form a government on their own, both sides agreed to form a \"grand coalition government\" with Elbegdorj as prime minister and MPRP chairman Nambaryn Enkhbayar as parliament speaker. The MPRP ended this coalition in 2006 and formed a government with the support of smaller parties.

His rule saw massive battleground defeats in the war with the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended with Karabakh Armenians controlling both the province and huge swathes of Azerbaijan proper. Around a million people were made homeless by the conflict and 35,000 people died. Elchibey fled a military revolt in which rogue units marched on Baku in 1993. Heydar Aliyev, then parliamentary speaker, took over as interim leader under the constitution and was then voted in as leader; he soon signed a ceasefire with Karabakh. Elchibey, who spent four years in internal exile in his native village in the country\\'s remote Nakhichevan region before returning to Baku in late 1997, accused Aliyev of usurping power.

He served in diplomatic posts in Russia (1885), Morocco (1892), Turkey (1893), and Washington, D.C. (1899). In 1899 he was selected for the post of high commissioner and consul-general for the international commission which the three protecting powers (Britain, the U.S., and Germany) appointed to report upon the existing troubles and future administration of the Samoan Islands. In 1900 he was knighted (K.C.M.G.) and appointed commissioner for the East African Protectorate (now Kenya) and consul-general for Zanzibar. He initiated a policy of white supremacy, collaborating with the farmers there (notably Lord Delamere, to whom he ceded 100,000 acres [40,500 ha] of land) and encouraging European immigration by the wholesale award of land concessions to European settlers. By 1903 he was encountering opposition from the Colonial Office, which felt he was proceeding too rapidly. In 1904, after being criticized for granting a concession on land previously reserved for the Masai, he resigned his position. In 1918 he reentered the service of the Foreign Office when he accepted the post of high commissioner and consul-general in Siberia, when Adm. Aleksandr Kolchak was making his fruitless effort to stem the Soviet march eastwards. In 1920 he became ambassador in Tokyo.

April 21, 1926, London, England - d. Sept. 8, 2022, Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire, Scotland), queen of the United Kingdom (1952-2022). She was the elder daughter of Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (great-great-granddaughter of Richard Colley Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley, and of William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, Duke of Portland). As the child of a younger son of King George V, the young Elizabeth had little prospect of acceding to the throne until her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in her father\\'s favour on Dec. 11, 1936, at which time her father became King George VI and she became heir presumptive. She married Philip Mountbatten (who was made Duke of Edinburgh; 1921-2021) on Nov. 20, 1947. Their first child, Prince Charles, was born Nov. 14, 1948. King George VI died on Feb. 6, 1952, and Elizabeth, who was on an official visit to Kenya at the time, flew back to London to be greeted as the new queen. Her coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, her son Prince Charles became heir apparent. The queen\\'s other children were Princess Anne (Elizabeth Alice Louise), b. Aug. 15, 1950; Prince Andrew (Albert Christian Edward), b. Feb. 19, 1960, and created Duke of York in 1986; and Prince Edward (Anthony Richard Louis), b. March 10, 1964, created Duke of Edinburgh in 2023. All these children have the surname \"of Windsor,\" but in 1960 Elizabeth decided to create the hyphenated name Mountbatten-Windsor for other descendants not styled prince or princess and royal highness. Elizabeth\\'s first grandchild (Princess Anne\\'s son) was born on Nov. 15, 1977. The queen seemed increasingly aware of the modern role of the monarchy, allowing, for example, the televising of the royal family\\'s domestic life in 1970 and condoning the formal dissolution of her sister\\'s marriage in 1978. Celebrating her golden jubilee in 2002, she succeeded in retaining public confidence in an era of rapid social change and intense media scrutiny. Many British colonies achieved independence during her reign, and several of them retained her as queen, so that she was finally queen of 15 independent countries.<SMALL><SUP>1</SUP></SMALL> In September 2015 she surpassed Queen Victoria\\'s record to become Britain\\'s longest-reigning monarch.

The following year he was given the prestigious position of \"gold commissioner\" in the prominent mining town of Lillooet, and fulfilled a variety of the town\\'s municipal duties. After the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia united in 1866, he became high sherriff, then police magistrate in Victoria. In 1875 he decided to run for a seat in the provincial legislature, and was elected in the key Victoria riding. Though his initial year in government was mired with controversy, his fellow MLAs saw potential in his leadership, and appointed him leader of the opposition. When Premier George Anthony Walkem lost a vote of confidence in 1876, Lieutenant Governor Sir Joseph William Trutch asked Elliott and his opposition party to form a government. As premier, he inherited a province that was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the federal government. While not a fevered separatist himself, Elliott found himself \"guilty by association\" in the eyes of the prime minister and governor-general, and received little help in calming his rebellious province. He tried to satisfy the B.C. isolationists by suspending construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, but this move was not popular, and further enforced the image of Elliott as a \"traitor\" to the Canadian dominion. In 1878 he was soundly defeated by Walkem\\'s opposition forces, and failed to even win his own seat.

Nov. 29, 1959, Chicago, Ill.), White House chief of staff (2009-10) and mayor of Chicago (2011-19). He launched his political career in the early 1980s, serving on Paul Simon\\'s successful 1984 U.S. Senate campaign. By 1989, when he was chief fund-raiser for Richard M. Daley\\'s mayoral race in Chicago, he had established a reputation as a hard-nosed political operator. In 1992 he joined Bill Clinton\\'s presidential campaign as finance director, and he became one of Clinton\\'s most trusted political advisers. He advanced such items on the Clinton agenda as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 assault-weapons ban. He left politics in 1998, returning to run, successfully, for the House of Representatives in 2002. After a disappointing showing for Democrats in the 2004 congressional elections, he was named head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2005. The 2006 midterm elections saw the Democrats pick up 30 seats and secure a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years. In 2007, at the start of the new congressional session, he was elected Democratic caucus chair. After the 2008 elections, in which Democrats won another 21 seats, one of President-elect Barack Obama\\'s first appointments was to name Emanuel as his chief of staff. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Washington, playing a significant role in the negotiations that led to the $787 billion stimulus package as well as the Affordable Care Act. In October 2010 he resigned in order to run for mayor of Chicago. He won the February 2011 election and took office in May. His first term was characterized by a controversial decision to shutter dozens of public schools and by the city\\'s first teachers\\' strike in 25 years. As a result, in the 2015 election a strong showing by a candidate backed by the teachers\\' union, Jesús García, prevented Emanuel from securing an outright majority and forced the city\\'s first-ever mayoral runoff, in which Emanuel emerged victorious. His second term was dominated by controversy over the shooting of Laquan McDonald, an African-American teenager, by a Chicago police officer. Emanuel\\'s support among the city\\'s black community evaporated. In September 2018 he announced that he would not seek a third term. In 2022 he became ambassador to Japan.<P>\\n\\n<B>Emanuels, Severinus Désiré</B> (b. Feb. 27, 1910, Rotterdam, Netherlands - d.

He was a prominent labour lawyer who served as an aide to former president Arnulfo Arias and was minister of planning and political economy in Arias\\' short-lived presidency of 1968. He was in exile in 1971-77. With Arias he refounded the Panamanist Party in 1978 to continue organized opposition to the military regime; as the regime recognized minority factions of the party, it changed its name to Authentic Panamanist Party in 1984 and Authentic Liberal Party in 1988. As leader of the latter, he was chosen by the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition, a broad coalition of opposition groups, to run as their candidate in the May 1989 presidential elections. He handily defeated the government\\'s nominee, Carlos Duque Jaén, but the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega annulled the elections. Endara was installed as president on Dec. 21, 1989, following the U.S. invasion of Panama and the ouster of Noriega\\'s regime. One of Endara\\'s first priorities was the disbandment of the Panama Defense Forces, which had propped up the Noriega regime; security became entrusted to a national police force. In 1990 he undertook a hunger strike in solidarity with the most needy of Panamanians at a time of severe economic crisis. Though ridiculed at first, the ploy had the desired effect and within a year the U.S. and other countries pledged $1 billion in aid. However, economic and social distress remained prevalent.

In 1628 Endecott, as one of the six grantees of the New England Company for a Plantation in Massachusetts, was chosen manager and governor of their settlement. In that year Endecott and about 30 settlers left on the ship <I>Abigail</I> from the port of Weymouth near Dorchester on June 20, 1628, and landed on Sept. 6, 1628, at Naumkeag, a location already occupied by a group of seceders from Plymouth who were led by Roger Conant. According to tradition, the establishment of good relations between the two groups prompted the change of the name of the settlement to Salem (from the Hebrew word <I>shalom</I>, \"peace\"). When the jurisdiction of the New England Company was supplanted by that of the Massachusetts Bay Company (1629), Endecott briefly served as the local governor (April 1629-June 1630) of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was succeeded in 1630 by John Winthrop, with whom he worked in harmony despite strong religious differences. In 1636 Endecott led a punitive expedition against the Algonquin in Connecticut which led to the Pequot War. Endecott almost continuously occupied prominent official positions in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He again served as governor in 1644-45, 1649-50, 1651-54, and 1655-64 and was deputy governor in 1641-44, 1650-51, and 1654-55.<P>\\n\\n<B>Endeley, Emmanuel (Mbela Liffafe)</B> (b.

He attempted to convert various émigré German worker groups - among them a socialist secret society, the League of the Just - as well as leading French socialists to his and Karl Marx\\'s views. When the league held its first congress in London in June 1847, Engels helped bring about its transformation into the Communist League. Marx and he together persuaded a second Communist Congress in London to adopt their views. The two men were authorized to draft a statement of Communist principles and policies, which appeared in 1848 as the <I>Manifest der kommunistischen Partei</I> (<I>Communist Manifesto</I>). The revolution of 1848, precipitated by the attempt of the German states to replace an authoritarian political system with a constitutional, representative form of government, was a momentous event in the lives of Marx and Engels. It was their only opportunity to participate directly in a revolution and to demonstrate their flexibility as revolutionary tacticians with the aim of turning the revolution into a Communist victory. After the failure of the revolution, Engels and Marx reorganized the Communist League and drafted tactical directives for the Communists in the belief that another revolution would soon take place. Engels wrote <I>Herrn Eugen Dührings Umwälzung der Wissenschaft</I> (1878; <I>Herr Eugen Dühring\\'s Revolution in Science</I>), the book that probably did most to promote Marxian thought. It destroyed the influence of Eugen Dühring, a Berlin professor who threatened to supplant Marx\\'s position among German Social Democrats.

After the Schmidt government fell from power in 1982, Engholm ran unsuccessfully for minister-president of his home state of Schleswig-Holstein in 1983 and 1987. Revelations about dirty campaign methods employed by the Christian Democrats in the latter election led to new elections in 1988, and Engholm became minister-president. In 1990 Engholm was chosen to succeed Hans-Jochen Vogel as chairman of the Social Democratic Party, and his appointment as its leader was confirmed in a party conference in 1991.

The Republican was elected to the state legislature in 1970, at 22, and remained there 20 years till he was elected governor. Most of that time he was in the minority. Even as Senate majority leader after 1983, when Republicans used recalls to seize control of the state Senate, Engler operated in a climate where liberals controlled most institutions. In 1990 he ran for governor and lagged behind Democrat James Blanchard in polls all through November. But his call for increasing education spending and cutting property taxes 20% was popular, and when Blanchard came forward with his own property tax cut, Engler effectively ridiculed it as saving a nickel a week per taxpayer. He won 50%-49%. Engler cut general assistance (welfare for non-parents) and aid to the arts; he privatized services and started seeking federal waivers for welfare reform. In 1994, Howard Wolpe won the Democratic primary and spent much on ads attacking Engler for approving a nuclear power plant and closing a mental health clinic. Engler\\'s attacks on Wolpe\\'s liberal House voting record were not diminished by Wolpe\\'s attacks on Engler for a September 1994 prison break at Detroit\\'s Ryan Correctional Facility, in which 10 prisoners escaped. Engler won 61%-38%, carrying all but two counties. He continued to pursue tax cuts and welfare reform. He stood clearly in command of state politics, and his experiments in Michigan\\'s laboratory of reform made him a national political and governmental figure as well, one who became a close adviser and role model to Speaker Newt Gingrich and the new Republican majority.

In this role he presided over a volatile political situation including violent protests over government corruption; he declared a state of emergency that lasted for several days in July 2008. In the 2009 presidential election he was defeated by Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj. In 2010 he founded a new MPRP after the old one renamed itself Mongolian People\\'s Party.

Two years as a department head in the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade (1987-89) convinced the young Communist that Mongolia\\'s ailing economy was in desperate need of a dose of the free market if it was to revive. He joined a group of young economists who met to discuss radical new reforms. When Mongolians took to the streets in 1990 in demonstrations for more democracy that heralded the end of Communist rule, he took charge of the new Research Centre on Market Economy. When the opposition Democratic Party was formed, he found a job as one of its main architects of economic policy. In July 1990, he was elected on a Democratic Party ticket to the Little Khural (upper house of parliament) in Mongolia\\'s first free general elections. There he headed the standing committee on economics where the first radical plans for Mongolia\\'s transition from decades of Stalinist central planning to the free market were laid. He soon won fame through his pressure for privatization, new banking systems and drastic economic reforms. In 1992 elections for a new unicameral parliament, or Great Khural, he was one of just six democrats who made it to the 76-seat house. The former Communists (MPRP) swept all 70 other seats. However, he resigned the following year to become head of the president\\'s office. When the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) agreed to bury their differences and to join forces against the former Communists for the 1996 elections, he was chosen as the leader most able to narrow their differences. The Democratic Union Coalition captured 50 seats in a shock victory over the MPRP, and he became prime minister. In 2005 he was a presidential candidate.

In the defense post, he administered martial law between 1972 and 1981. At the same time, he, like other Marcos ministers, accumulated great wealth. His ambition grew, but before he could become a competitor for the presidency, Marcos reduced his power. Enrile was more complicated than the average politician in authoritarian government. Although he had presided over the 1972 arrest and eight-year detention of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., Enrile reportedly cried upon seeing the assassinated man\\'s body in August 1983. Among the Marcos inner circle, he was the only one who tried to attend Aquino\\'s funeral. On Feb. 22, 1986, he left the people of the Philippines rubbing their eyes when he barricaded himself and his military supporters inside defense headquarters and announced he was abandoning the Marcos government to support Corazon Aquino, Benigno\\'s widow, who, just weeks before, had lost to Marcos in an apparently rigged election. By February 25 Enrile\\'s rebellion and Aquino-inspired street demonstrations had broken Marcos\\'s 20-year stranglehold on the presidency. He was retained as defense minister by new president Aquino, but just weeks after helping her come to power, he began scorning her policies, particularly that of negotiating with the country\\'s Communist insurgents.

Elected to the legislature as an independent in 1969, the next year he formed an Islamic party, but it was banned by the military government in 1971. He re-formed the party in 1972 and served as a deputy prime minister (1974, 1975-77, 1977-78). In 1980 the military again banned his party and briefly put him in prison. He was prohibited from engaging in politics from 1980 to 1987. His third attempt to form a political party was more successful, and the Welfare (Refah) Party became especially well organized on the local level, where it opposed what many saw as the arrogant corruption of the leaders of the established parties. In the 1995 campaign Erbakan advocated withdrawing from NATO, abrogating agreements with Israel, and developing closer ties with Middle Eastern nations like Syria and Iran. His proposals were particularly unsettling to Western leaders, who had long depended on a friendly secular government in Turkey as a basis for their Middle East policy. Welfare won the December 1995 elections, becoming the first Islamic party ever to win a general election in Turkey. Early in 1996 Erbakan tried but failed to form a coalition government. A centre-right coalition of the True Path and Motherland parties was brought down by internal disagreements in June. Erbakan was again asked to try to form a coalition, and this time, when Tansu Çiller agreed to join him, he succeeded. He was forced out of office in 1997 after months of wrangling with the strictly secularist military after attempting to introduce mild religious reforms into public life. In February 1998 he lost his seat in parliament as the Welfare Party was disbanded. He was barred from political leadership until 2003.<P>\\n\\n<B>Erbe, Norman A(rthur)</B> (b.

Feb. 26, 1954, Istanbul, Turkey), prime minister (2003-14) and president (2014-&nbsp;) of Turkey. His political career began in 1984, when he was elected chairman of the Welfare Party\\'s office in Beyoglu; in 1985 he was elected head of the party\\'s Istanbul branch, and a member of the party\\'s executive board. Elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994, he was credited for improving sanitation and the environment in the city, and working to prevent crime. He banned the sale of alcohol in cafés, however, an act which displeased secularists. His devout adherence to Islamic values led to his conviction in 1998 for inciting religious hatred. He had read a poem in 1997 that included the lines, \"the mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets, and the faithful our soldiers.\" He served four months in prison and was barred from running for, or holding, political office. He became leader of the reformist wing of the Virtue Party after the banning of the Welfare Party in 1998. When the Virtue Party was outlawed in July 2001, he was involved in founding the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi; AKP) in August of that year and was elected its leader. The AK swept the parliamentary elections of November 2002, winning 363 of 550 seats. Erdogan, still unable to stand for office, remained leader of the AK while Abdullah Gül was named prime minister. In February 2003, parliament amended the constitution, allowing Erdogan to be a candidate in parliamentary by-elections. He was elected MP from Siirt on March 9 and became prime minister on March 14. Erdogan, who had moderated his advocacy for Islamic values since his founding of the AKP, kept religion largely off the agenda as prime minister and campaigned to get his country admitted to the European Union, which he had formerly characterized as a \"Christian club.\" He reduced the influence of the military and won strong victories in the 2007 and 2011 elections but the increasingly authoritarian character of his government led to widespread protests in 2013. In 2014 he won Turkey\\'s first direct presidential elections. The failure of an attempted military coup in 2016 was seen as strengthening his position; he used the opportunity to conduct massive purges in all areas. In a 2017 constitutional referendum, he obtained 51% support for a strong presidential system. He was reelected in 2018 and 2023.<P>\\n\\n<B>Erdös, André</B> (b.

After World War II, he was entrusted by the Allied occupation authorities with the reconstruction of industry in the Nürnberg-Fürth area, and successively served as economics adviser in Middle and Upper Franconia, economics minister for Bavaria (1945-46), director of the Advisory Committee for Money and Credit (1947-48), and director of the economic council for the joint Anglo-U.S. occupation zone (1948-49). By the end of 1948 the currency reforms that he had instituted the preceding summer, coupled with the abolition of rationing and of other commercial restrictions, had already somewhat buoyed the prostrate German economy. As economy minister (1949-63) of the new Federal Republic of Germany under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Erhard continued his policies of reconstruction with phenomenal results, achieving what has often been called the German \"economic miracle.\" He had an unbounding faith in his economic ideas which he called \"social market economy.\" It was largely based on a free market, and the opposition taunted him at first with charges that there was nothing very much social about it. In 1957 Erhard was appointed vice-chancellor and was regarded as Adenauer\\'s heir apparent. He succeeded Adenauer in 1963, but the great hopes set in him at the outset of his chancellorship soon evaporated under the impact of domestic confusion and blunders. Although he won the election of 1965, his call for tax increases in response to a slight recession in the summer of 1966 caused the Free Democratic Party to defect, and in December he resigned.

From 1927 he took an active part in the Liberal (Venstre) party\\'s youth organization and was national chairman from 1929 to 1932. He was elected a member of the Folketing (lower chamber) in 1935 and was afterward repeatedly reelected. In 1941 he was elected deputy speaker. In May 1945 he joined the Vilhelm Buhl coalition cabinet as minister of agriculture and fisheries and retained this portfolio in Knud Kristensen\\'s Liberal cabinet (November 1945-November 1947). When Hans Hedtoft\\'s Socialist cabinet was in power (November 1947-October 1950) Eriksen led the Liberal opposition in the Folketing. Following the elections of Sept. 5, 1950, he formed a Liberal-Conservative coalition cabinet. He led a party which had always been a farmers\\' party but under his leadership began for the first time to seek support in towns. His greatest achievement was the Danish constitutional reform of 1953 in which the upper chamber (Landsting) was abolished, the voting age reduced to 21 years, and female throne succession introduced, paving the way for Queen Margrethe II to succeed to the throne. His political career ended in 1965 when the party rejected his long-held dream of uniting with the Conservatives to form a strong liberal alternative to the Social Democrats. The bride was willing at the time but his own party was not and he resigned as party leader in disappointment. Like many other Scandinavian politicians he favoured Nordic cooperation and from 1964 to 1971 was chairman of the Nordic Association in Denmark.

After working on the Employment Commission in the mid-1930s, he became an assistant at the Ministry of Social Welfare (1937) and its undersecretary of state (1938). He was minister without portfolio (1944) and minister of education (1945), became prime minister and chairman of the Social Democratic Party following the sudden death of Per Albin Hansson in 1946 and remained in both posts until October 1969. He headed a series of coalition governments, but in 1968 his party won an overall majority in the Riksdag\\'s lower house. From 1971 to 1973 he sat in the new single-chamber Riksdag that his government had championed since 1955. Over the course of Erlander\\'s long tenure, Sweden increased its social-welfare legislation with the passage of greater old-age benefits, child allowances, and rent subsidies. His educational reforms included extending compulsory education to nine years and increasing higher-educational opportunities. In foreign policy he promoted Sweden\\'s traditional stance of neutrality; his keeping the country out of NATO resulted in heavy expenditures on defense.

Feb. 1, 1930, Rangpur district, Bengal, India [now in northern Bangladesh] - d. July 14, 2019, Dhaka, Bangladesh), president of Bangladesh (1983-90). He was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1952. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1969. During the Bangladesh war for independence in 1971, he was in Pakistan. He later returned to Bangladesh, where he was taken into the new army as an adjutant general. In 1975 he was made a major general and appointed deputy army chief of staff by Ziaur Rahman, who was then army chief. He was picked by Rahman to succeed him in his post as chief of the army staff when the latter became chief martial law administrator and then president in 1977. Ershad built up some popular goodwill when he stood by Pres. Abdus Sattar and the constitution during the crisis-ridden days that followed the assassination of Rahman in May 1981. But he fell out with the aging Sattar soon after the latter\\'s election in November 1981. The cause of the disagreement was the role of the armed forces. Although he was snubbed by Sattar, who insisted that the armed forces had only one role to play - to look after the defense and security of the country - he waited to strike until the Sattar administration showed signs of cracking up, with the president himself openly admitting that the political and economic situation was verging on collapse. Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup and proclaimed himself chief martial law administrator in March 1982. In 1983 he made himself president. He resigned as chief of army staff in 1986. After nationwide protests he resigned in 1990 and was arrested. He was freed on bail on Jan. 9, 1997, to fight the last of 17 cases of corruption and misuse of power but was sent back to jail on Nov. 20, 2000, to finish a 5-year sentence over a graft charge after he exhausted the appeal process. Released on bail again in 2001, he was elected to parliament in 2008, 2014, and 2018. He was leader of the opposition in 2019.

Oct. 25, 1895, Oratovo, near Kiev, Russia [now in Ukraine] - d. Feb. 26, 1969, Jerusalem), prime minister of Israel (1963-69). In 1914 he emigrated to Palestine and when the British army entered Palestine during World War I, he enlisted in the 40th Royal Fusiliers of the Jewish Legion, where he began his association with David Ben-Gurion and other future leaders of Israel. Active in Hapoel Hazair, a Zionist labour party which later merged into Mapai, he was a delegate to the founding conference of the Jewish labour federation Histadrut. In 1944 Ben-Gurion appointed him to the high command of the Haganah, the underground Jewish defense force. After Israel\\'s independence in 1948 his family name was Hebraized. He first entered the cabinet as agriculture minister in 1951, and in 1952 became finance minister. His popularity, personal charm, and conciliatory talents were often used by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion to smooth over domestic political troubles, and Eshkol gradually evolved as the number two man in the government. He accepted the prime minister\\'s post in 1963 with reluctance, and followed the basic policies of his illustrious predecessor. However, by making concessions to political rivals which Ben-Gurion had firmly declined to consider, he enraged Ben-Gurion to the point where he publicly declared Eshkol unfit to govern. The outstanding event of his six-year tenure was the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which ended with Israel ruling over more territory than ever before. The mellow and affable Eshkol appeared so unseemly as a war leader that in the critical days before the 1967 eruption his closest associates compelled him to turn over his defense portfolio to his political archfoe Gen. Moshe Dayan.<P>\\n\\n<B>Eshmambetova, Zamira (Bakiyevna)</B> (b. Osh, Kirgiz S.S.R.), Kyrgyz diplomat.

He entered the army at age 15 and fought with Spanish forces in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars and in the rebellious Americas. On the death of Fernando VII he showed himself a strong supporter of the queen regent María Cristina and enthusiastically joined the forces opposed to Don Carlos (Carlos María Isidro de Borbón). He was made commander-in-chief and, for his victory over the Carlists at the Battle of Luchana (December 1836), was created conde de Luchana. He became for short periods war minister (1837, 1837-38) and prime minister (1837). Later he opened up the negotiations that led to the Convention of Vergara (1839) and ended the civil war. This success earned Espartero the popular sobriquet \"the Peacemaker of Spain\" and the title duque de la Victoria. On his return to Madrid (1840) he became again head of the government. María Cristina preferred to resign the regency (October 1840) rather than accept his program of reforms. He was then (May 1841) himself appointed regent by the Cortes (parliament). In 1843 Generals Ramón Narváez and Francisco Serrano rose against him and obliged him to flee to England, where he lived until 1849, when he returned to Spain and lived in retirement at Logroño. He made his reappearance as prime minister in 1854-56, sharing control of the government with Gen. Leopoldo O\\'Donnell during the so-called <I>bienio progresista</I>. He retired in 1864.

He brought the Moroccan war to an end in 1927, but soon afterwards lost the support of the army, the ruling class, and the king.

Estrada</TR></TABLE>\\n<B>Estrada, Joseph (Marcelo Ejercito),</B> original name Joseph Marcelo Ejercito (b. April 19, 1937, Manila, Philippines), president of the Philippines (1998-2001). When he decided to become an actor, his parents, displeased with his decision to drop out of college, forbade him to use his family name, which forced him to adopt Estrada (Spanish for \"street\") as a screen name. As he won one acting award after another, people began calling him Erap - for <I>pare</I> spelled backwards, meaning \"pal.\" He entered politics when he ran for mayor of Manila\\'s San Juan town in 1968. He was only proclaimed mayor in 1969, after he won an electoral protest against Braulio Sto. He kept the post until 1986. He was elected senator in 1987 and, in 1992, ran for vice president on the National People\\'s Coalition ticket. Although the party\\'s presidential candidate, Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr., lost the election, Estrada won the vice presidential contest. On May 11, 1998, he was elected president in generally peaceful elections. But he reeled from one controversy after another soon after taking office and in October 2000 a former political ally, provincial governor Luis \"Chavit\" Singson, stunned the nation with revelations that he had handed Estrada more than 400 million pesos in bribes from illegal gambling syndicates. Impeachment proceedings collapsed after the prosecution walked out in disgust when pro-Estrada senators voted to keep out of the trial bank records which prosecutors said would show the fortune Estrada had been keeping in banks using aliases. On Jan. 20, 2001, at the peak of a \"people power\" revolt in which hundreds of thousands of Filipinos surged into the streets demanding his head, Estrada left the presidential palace for the last time. In September 2007 he was found guilty of corruption and given a life sentence, but in October he was pardoned by Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. In 2010 he unsuccessfully ran again for president. In 2013-19 he was mayor of Manila.<P>\\n\\n<B>Estrada (Morales), Juan José</B> (b. Jan. 1, 1872, Managua, Nicaragua - d.

He was director of the Secretariat of Social Development (2000) and a presidential candidate (2007, 2011, 2015). His candidacy in 2019 was revoked after he was arrested in Miami, Fla., and charged in Manhattan federal court with conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and a related weapons offense.<P>\\n\\n<A NAME=\"estrac\"><B>Estrada Cabrera, Manuel (José)</B> (b. Nov. 21, 1857, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala - d. Sept. 24, 1924, Guatemala City, Guatemala), president of Guatemala (1898-1920). He was a Supreme Court judge before being elected to Congress in 1885. He became minister of interior and justice under Pres. José María Reina Barrios from 1892 and took over as president when Reina Barrios was assassinated in 1898. After early sponsorship of public health, education, and agricultural and communications improvements, widespread corruption set in, although there was economic advance, leading to the emergence of a new elite of coffee planters. Germans became dominant in coffee growing. The lands of indigenous people were confiscated and made available to the new elite, who in turn hired the same people to work the coffee plantations. In 1901 Estrada hired the U.S. United Fruit Company to manage the national postal service, and three years later he granted the company a generous concession to construct a railway between Puerto Barrios and Guatemala City. He ruled increasingly as a tyrannical dictator, employing secret police informers and using the army to suppress uprisings and strikes. Immediately after taking over as president, he changed the constitution to end the restriction to single presidential terms, and he was subsequently reelected on four occasions, in rigged contests. Dissatisfaction dramatically increased following his government\\'s apathetic response to earthquakes that struck Guatemala City in late 1917 and early 1918. Church leaders joined the middle sector in forming the Unionist Party, which demanded his resignation. A revolution in 1920, triggered by the murder of an anti-government legislator, attracted broad support. It resulted in the Congress declaring Estrada \"mentally incompetent\" and forcing him to resign. He died in prison.<P>\\n\\n<B>Estrada Cajigal, Vicente</B> (b.

He was also mayor of Cuernavaca (1990-91, 1997-2000). Accusations that Morelos, a popular weekend retreat for the rich near Mexico City, was a haven for drug smuggling, embarrassed Pres. Vicente Fox, who distanced himself from the governor (both were members of the National Action Party). In October 2004 the state congress voted to remove Estrada from his post on allegations he knowingly appointed a state police chief with ties to drug trafficking.

April 16, 1825, Sorø, Denmark - d. Dec. 24, 1913, Copenhagen, Denmark), prime minister and finance minister of Denmark (1875-94). In 1854-55 he sat in the Folketing, the lower house of the Rigsdag. In 1864 he entered the Landsting (upper house) and, as a member of the National Landowners\\' Party, played a prominent part in the revision of the constitution (July 1866), giving landowners extensive power in the Landsting. He then became the leader of a powerful group in the Landsting. As interior minister (1865-69) he made major improvements in the railways and in Esbjerg harbour. The salient feature of Danish politics during subsequent years was the struggle between the two houses, beginning in 1872 when a combination of all the radical parties rejected the budget. In 1875, when Estrup became prime minister, the crisis became acute. The right demanded large appropriations for defense, but the Folketing rejected Estrup\\'s motion on fortifications. From 1885 his government maintained itself in power by letting the king declare provisional budgets. The Liberals considered the measures unconstitutional; Estrup counteracted public unrest with police action and a stricter penal code. Faced with a strong Conservative Party, the Liberal Party broke into factions, and the Conservatives, under Estrup\\'s leadership, controlled the government for nearly two decades. He carried through some social reforms with the help of the moderate Liberals, whose majority also supported the Financial Act of April 1894, the first time a budget was once more regularly adopted by both houses. The act contained grants for temporary military installations but repealed his earlier police and press measures. He resigned in August 1894, remaining a prominent critic of Liberal governments.<P>\\n\\n<B>Esuene, Helen (Udoka)</B> (b. Nov. 23, 1949), Nigerian politician; widow of Udoakaha Esuene.

He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Balmain in 1925. In 1930 the federal Labor government of James Scullin appointed him as the youngest-ever member of the High Court of Australia. There he served with distinction until 1940, when he resigned to enter federal politics. Elected MP for the Sydney seat of Barton, he became minister for external affairs and attorney-general in the Labor government of John Curtin in 1941. He was an Australian delegate to the San Francisco conference in April 1945 which founded the United Nations, and played a leading role in resolving the Palestine dispute in 1947; in 1948-49 he was president of the General Assembly. In 1946 he became deputy prime minister. When Labor lost office in December 1949 he remained deputy leader of the Labor Party, and was elected leader when Joseph Benedict Chifley died in June 1951. As opposition leader to Robert Menzies\\'s Liberal government he defended civil liberties in the Cold War context, notably in successfully campaigning to defeat a proposal to ban the Communist Party. He led the Labor Party to three successive election defeats in 1954, 1955, and 1958. His judgement grew increasingly erratic and in 1955 he caused a split in his party when he attacked its conservative Catholic wing. There were many plots against his leadership, but such was his prestige in the Labor movement that he survived until February 1960, when ill-health caused him to resign. He was appointed chief justice of New South Wales, but suffered a mental breakdown in 1962 and retired from public life.

He became head of state in a coup in 1980 which ousted the civilian government of Süleyman Demirel during a period of political and economic instability. Civil order was restored by way of the arrest of up to 100,000 suspects, some of whom were tortured. In a 1982 referendum a new constitution was approved, automatically constituting his election for a seven-year term as president. He allowed the restoration of democratic rule in 1983, although the pre-coup parties and major political figures were banned.

He started in the Democratic Party as a precinct worker and was chairman of the state party when he made his first bid for public office, winning the governor\\'s seat in 1970, defeating incumbent Republican Norbert Tiemann. His perennial rallying cry as governor was \"hold the line\" on taxes and he regularly criticized the legislature, sometimes referring to lawmakers as \"wild-eyed spenders.\" He was reelected in 1974 by a landslide and became the first Nebraska governor to serve eight years (the term of office changed from two to four years the year he was elected). In 1978 he rode his popularity to the U.S. Senate, being elected with 68% of the vote. In 1984, however, he came within 25,000 votes of defeat. He won a third term in 1990, fending off rumours he was a heavy drinker. Serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Exon helped shape U.S. military policy during the final years of the Cold War. He was also a stalwart defender of the controversial B-2 stealth bomber. He said his proudest achievement was helping to author and secure passage of a spending reduction of $13 billion in 1994.

Born Étienne Eyadéma Gnassingbé, he enlisted in the French army (1953) as Étienne Eyadéma, his two given names. He recovered the name Gnassingbé only in 1974, when he dropped the \"Étienne\" as part of a campaign of \"authenticity.\" Gnassingbé became his first name. He served in Indochina, Dahomey (now Benin), Niger, and Algeria (1953-61), and attained the rank of staff sergeant when he returned to Togo in 1962. When Pres. Sylvanus Olympio refused to take 626 Togolese veterans of French wars into Togo\\'s tiny army, a group of them, including Eyadéma, attacked the presidential palace on the night of Jan. 13, 1963, and killed Olympio the following dawn in an otherwise almost bloodless coup. They installed a civilian, Nicolas Grunitzky, as president. Grunitzky appointed Eyadéma to head the army in 1965. On Jan. 13, 1967, Eyadéma went on national radio to say the army had peacefully seized power \"with no intention of holding on to it.\" In April he declared himself president and minister of national defense. He invited past political exiles to return, and in 1969 he set up a new unity party (the Rally of the Togolese People) and became its president. He won a plebiscite in 1972 and one-party presidential elections in 1979 and 1986. His long rule brought a measure of stability to Togo, but economic gains achieved in the 1970s were largely negated in the 1980s by mismanagement and corruption. He won a 1993 poll which was boycotted by the opposition after the candidacy of the late president\\'s son, Gilchrist Olympio, was rejected. Elections in 1998 were the first to threaten his reign. He officially won 52.1% of the vote; Olympio was announced as having come second in the poll, but claimed he actually won. In 2003 Eyadéma\\'s reelection was made possible only after the modification of the constitution, which limited the presidential terms, and after the candidacy of Olympio was again rejected. He was also chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (1977-78, 1980-81, 1999) and of the Organization of African Unity (2000-01).<P>\\n\\n<B>Eydoux, Pierre (Alfred Henri)</B> (b.

Jan. 3, 1988, Leuven, Belgium), prime minister of Belgium (1949-50, 1958-61, 1968-73). In 1939 he entered parliament as a member of the Catholic (later Social Christian) Party, serving as minister of finance in 1945 and 1947-49, then being chosen to head a new coalition government. This government fell in 1950 during the controversy over the possible restoration of exiled King Léopold III. Eyskens briefly became economy minister in 1950, but he was recalled as prime minister in 1958. He successfully negotiated an end to a complicated dispute involving the right of students to attend either state or parochial schools without undue financial burdens, but economic problems, coupled with the high cost of the Congo\\'s independence, forced him to institute new austerity measures. He was defeated in the 1961 election but was again finance minister (1965-66) and began a third term as prime minister in 1968. In the early 1970s he lessened tensions between the Flemish-speaking population in the north and the French-speaking Walloons in the south by granting each group cultural autonomy. In 1971 he presided over constitutional reforms that granted greater autonomy to Flanders and Wallonia, but friction resurfaced over the issue of regionalization. Eyskens failed to solve the dispute and resigned in November 1972.<P>\\n\\n<TABLE ALIGN=\"Right\"><TR><TD><IMG SRC=\"eyskem.jpg\" HEIGHT=\"100\"><BR>M.
